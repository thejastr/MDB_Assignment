# MDB_Assignment
Build a server capable of receiving text messages from clients. The server should print the text messages on standard output, but should not print any other messages such as debug information. From the server perspective, a message corresponds to the data received from a particular client during a communication session with that client. The server should be listening for text messages to a port known to the clients. The server should be able to receive text messages from multiple clients. When multiple clients simultaneously try to send text messages to the server, the server should print them one at a time (in any order). 
Note that you don't have to implement an event-driven or multi-threaded server. Serving one client at a time is enough.Â
